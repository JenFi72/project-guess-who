Guess Who Game

## The problem
The task was to create our own digital version of the classic board game Guess Who. In order to achieve the requirements to the website should be able to:
Set a secret person for each round that you should guess on. Dependent on which attributes you chose, the game should filter out possible candidates that could be the secret person. 

If I would do this again I would start earlier and put more time to make it responsive and look good in all devices.
